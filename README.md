## Data

The visualisation shows articles published in 2018/19 by a few selected journals (The Lancet, Cell, Nature, Science).
The data has been downloaded from [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/home.uri) in Feb 2021.

The impact factor of an academic journal reflects the average number of citations that articles published in 2018/19 received up until now (Feb 2021).
